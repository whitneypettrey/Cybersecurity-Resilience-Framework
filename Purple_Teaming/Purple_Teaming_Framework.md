# Purple Teaming Framework

## Overview
Purple teaming is a collaborative approach to cybersecurity that bridges the gap between offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) security operations. This framework provides guidelines, templates, and exercises to enhance collaboration and improve organizational resilience.

---

## Objectives
- Enhance collaboration between red and blue teams.
- Identify and address gaps in detection and response.
- Simulate real-world attack scenarios to improve resilience.
- Test and validate the effectiveness of defensive tools and processes.

---

## Key Components

### 1. **Planning Phase**
   - Define objectives and scope for the exercise.
   - Assign roles (e.g., red team, blue team, observer).
   - Identify key assets, systems, and scenarios to test.
   - Establish success metrics.

   **Deliverables**:
   - Scope Document
   - Team Assignments
   - Success Metrics Template

---

### 2. **Execution Phase**
   - Red Team: Execute simulated attack scenarios.
     - Examples:
       - Phishing simulations
       - Credential harvesting
       - Lateral movement tests
   - Blue Team: Monitor, detect, and respond to simulated attacks.
   - Observers: Document activities, gaps, and areas for improvement.

   **Tools**:
   - Offensive: Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, custom scripts.
   - Defensive: SIEM platforms, EDR solutions, log analysis tools.

---

### 3. **Analysis Phase**
   - Compare red team activities with blue team detections.
   - Identify gaps in tools, processes, or skills.
   - Assess performance against success metrics.

   **Key Questions**:
   - Were all attack scenarios detected?
   - How quickly were they identified and mitigated?
   - What improvements can be made to enhance detection and response?

---

### 4. **Improvement Phase**
   - Create an action plan to address identified gaps.
   - Enhance defensive measures (e.g., SIEM rules, playbooks, training).
   - Plan for the next purple team exercise to assess improvements.

   **Deliverables**:
   - Gap Analysis Report
   - Action Plan
   - Updated Detection Rules

## Sample Purple Team Exercise: Credential Harvesting Simulation

### **Scenario**:
Simulate an attacker sending a phishing email to harvest user credentials.

### **Steps**:
1. **Red Team**:
   - Use a phishing toolkit (e.g., Gophish) to send simulated phishing emails.
   - Capture user credentials using a controlled landing page.

2. **Blue Team**:
   - Monitor email traffic and endpoints for suspicious activity.
   - Investigate logs for signs of credential harvesting.

3. **Observers**:
   - Document timeline of events and gaps in detection.

### **Metrics**:
- Detection time: How quickly was the phishing activity identified?
- Response time: How quickly were affected accounts secured?
- Coverage: Were all simulated attacks detected?

## Key Metrics for Purple Teaming
- **Time to Detection (TTD)**: Average time to identify an attack.
- **Time to Response (TTR)**: Average time to mitigate an attack.
- **Detection Rate**: Percentage of attacks detected by blue team tools.
- **False Positives**: Number of false positives triggered during the exercise.
- **Gap Coverage**: Number of gaps identified and addressed.

---

## Resources
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**: [https://attack.mitre.org](https://attack.mitre.org)
- **Recommended Tools**:
  - Offensive: Metasploit, Empire, Cobalt Strike
  - Defensive: Splunk, ELK Stack, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike

---

## Conclusion
Purple teaming fosters a culture of collaboration, enabling organizations to proactively identify and address gaps in their security posture. Regular exercises and continuous improvement are key to maintaining resilience against evolving threats.

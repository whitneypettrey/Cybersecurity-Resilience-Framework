# Threat Actor Profiling Framework

## Overview
Threat actor profiling is the process of systematically identifying, analyzing, and categorizing adversaries to understand their motivations, capabilities, and tactics. Effective profiling enables organizations to anticipate and mitigate threats before they materialize, fostering a proactive cybersecurity strategy.

This framework leverages industry-leading methodologies, including the **MITRE ATT&CK** framework, to provide a comprehensive approach to threat actor profiling.

---

## Objectives
1. **Understand Adversaries**: Gain insights into attacker behavior, tools, and goals.
2. **Enhance Defenses**: Use profiles to fine-tune detection, prevention, and response mechanisms.
3. **Prioritize Threats**: Focus on high-risk actors targeting critical assets.
4. **Collaborate Effectively**: Share profiles across teams to align defense strategies.

## Threat Actor Profiling Components

### **1. Actor Identification**
- Identify and document key characteristics of the threat actor.
- Sources of information:
  - **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: CrowdStrike, Recorded Future, Mandiant.
  - **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: Social media, forums, and paste sites.
  - **Internal Logs**: Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from previous incidents.

**Example Data Points**:
| Field              | Example                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Name/Alias         | APT29 (Cozy Bear)                 |
| Origin/Region      | Russia                            |
| Affiliation        | Nation-State                     |
| Known Targets      | Government, Energy, Healthcare    |
| Primary Objectives | Espionage, Data Exfiltration      |

---

### **2. Motivation Analysis**
Understanding what drives a threat actor is crucial for anticipating their behavior.

**Categories of Motivation**:
- **Nation-State**: Espionage, sabotage, or geopolitical gain.
- **Cybercriminal**: Financial gain, ransomware, or fraud.
- **Hacktivist**: Political or social causes.
- **Insider Threat**: Personal grievances or financial incentives.

**Example**:
- **Motivation**: Espionage.
- **Likely Targets**: Government networks, defense contractors.
- **Associated Groups**: APT groups with ties to specific governments.

---

### **3. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**
Analyze the tools and methodologies used by the threat actor.
- Use the **MITRE ATT&CK Framework** to map TTPs.
- Document patterns across the cyber kill chain.

**Example Mapping**:
| Kill Chain Phase    | Technique                 | Tool/Method              |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Initial Access      | Spearphishing            | Custom Malware, Phishing |
| Execution           | Remote Code Execution    | PowerShell Scripts       |
| Persistence         | Scheduled Task/Job       | Cron Jobs                |
| Exfiltration        | Data Transfer to Cloud   | AWS, Google Drive        |

---

### **4. Capability Assessment**
Evaluate the technical sophistication and resources available to the actor.
- **Low**: Script kiddies, basic tools.
- **Medium**: Advanced tools, limited operational scope.
- **High**: Sophisticated tools, large-scale operations, state support.

**Key Questions**:
- Do they have zero-day exploit capabilities?
- Are their operations funded or supported by a government or large organization?

---

### **5. Historical Activity**
Document past incidents and campaigns attributed to the actor.
- Include:
  - Attack timelines.
  - Targeted industries or regions.
  - Success rate and known impacts.

**Example**:
- **Incident**: SolarWinds Supply Chain Attack.
- **Impact**: Data breach affecting government agencies and enterprises globally.

---

### **6. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
Track specific artifacts associated with the actor.
- **Types of IOCs**:
  - IP Addresses
  - File Hashes
  - URLs/Domains
  - Malware Signatures
- **Tools for IOC Management**:
  - MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)
  - STIX/TAXII for structured data sharing.

---

### **7. Threat Intelligence Sharing**
Collaborate with peers, vendors, and ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers) to enhance visibility.

**Recommended Platforms**:
- **ISACs**: FS-ISAC, MS-ISAC.
- **Vendors**: CrowdStrike ThreatGraph, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42.

---

## Tools and Resources for Profiling
### **1. Tools**
- **Threat Intelligence Platforms**: Recorded Future, ThreatConnect.
- **Frameworks**: MITRE ATT&CK, Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain.
- **Open-Source Tools**:
  - YARA: Signature-based malware detection.
  - MISP: Collaborative threat intelligence sharing.
